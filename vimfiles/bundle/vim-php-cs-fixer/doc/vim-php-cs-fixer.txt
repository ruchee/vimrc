Integrate PHP CS Fixer (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

This plugin will execute the php-cs-fixer command
on the directory or file (depends on which command you call).

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS					    *vim-php-cs-fixer-mappings*

<leader>pcd		Calls php-cs-fixer on the current directory of
			the file.

<leader>pcf		Calls php-cs-fixer on the current file.


To change default mappings, there are two commands available to you.
`PhpCsFixerFixDirectory()`
`PhpCsFixerFixFile()`

A possible remapping could be
`nnoremap <silent><leader>d :call PhpCsFixerFixDirectory()<CR>`
`nnoremap <silent><leader>f :call PhpCsFixerFixFile()<CR>`
