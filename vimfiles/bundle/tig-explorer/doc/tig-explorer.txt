COMMANDS                                               *tig-explorer-commands*

Add following script to ~/.vimrc

TigOpenCurrentFile                                       *:TigOpenCurrentFile*
    Open tig with current file

TigOpenProjectRootDir                                 *:TigOpenProjectRootDir*
    Open tig with Project root path

TigGrep                                                             *:TigGrep*
    Open tig grep.
    And you can pass PATTERN like `:TigGrep (PATTERN)` to grep
    with the PATTERN.

TigGrepResume                                                 *:TigGrepResume*
    Resume from last grep

TigBlame                                                           *:TigBlame*
    Open tig blame with current file

TigOpenFileWithCommit
    Open a file at the given commit.  `:TigOpenWithCommit COMMIT FILE LINEO`
    All arguments are optional.
    If FILE contains `%` and `FILE` is contains so commit information.
    The `%` in the commit will be replaced with the original commit.

    For example `:TigOpenWithCommit %~` open the previous version of the
    current file. This file will be called `HEAD~:file`.
    Calling `:TigOpenFileWithCommit %~` again will open the previous version
    of the previous version (`HEAD~~`).

TigOpenFileWithCommit!
    Like TigOpenFileWithCommit but show the diff between the current buffer
    and the resulting buffer.

    For example, `:vertical TigOpenFileWithCommit! HEAD` set a side by side
    diff between the current buffer and its HEAD version.

==============================================================================
KEYMAPS                                                 *tig-explorer-keymaps*

Following commands are available on tig launched from tig-explorer

e, <Ctrl-o>: edit on existing tab
<Ctrl-t>   : edit on new tab
<Ctrl-s>   : edit with split window
<Ctrl-v>   : edit with vsplit window

<ESC> o: open with commit on existing tab
<ESC> t: open with commit on new tab
<ESC> v: open with commit with vsplit window
<ESC> s: open with commit with split window

 When a commit is available (in main, blame, tree, refs view) view, the
 version of the file corresponding to this commit will be open instead of the
 version in the working directory. Split versions will open the two buffer in
 diff mode.
 
==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZE                                             *tig-explorer-customize*

Keymaps can be cusotmized by following variables.

Following keymap is defined as defaut >
    let g:tig_explorer_keymap_edit_e  = 'e'
    let g:tig_explorer_keymap_edit    = '<C-o>'
    let g:tig_explorer_keymap_tabedit = '<C-t>'
    let g:tig_explorer_keymap_split   = '<C-s>'
    let g:tig_explorer_keymap_vsplit  = '<C-v>'
<

And you can add following script to ~/.vimrc

>
    " open tig with current file
    nnoremap <Leader>T :TigOpenCurrentFile<CR>

    " open tig with Project root path
    nnoremap <Leader>t :TigOpenProjectRootDir<CR>

    " open tig grep
    nnoremap <Leader>g :TigGrep<CR>

    " resume from last grep
    nnoremap <Leader>r :TigGrepResume<CR>

    " open tig grep with the selected word
    vnoremap <Leader>g :TigGrep<Space><C-R>"<CR>

    " open tig grep with the word under the cursor
    nnoremap <Leader>cg :<C-u>:TigGrep<Space><C-R><C-W><CR>

    " open tig blame with current file
    nnoremap <Leader>b :TigBlame<CR>
<

By default tig-explorer will use the builtin terminal if available.
To force launching tig-explorer as shell command you can add the following to
~/.vimrc

>
    " don't use builtin terminal
    let g:tig_explorer_use_builtin_term=0
<
