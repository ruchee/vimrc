This plugin improves Vim's support for editing R code and makes it possible to integrate Vim with R. The functionality is similar to what you can find in Tinn-R and ESS mode of Emacs. This filetype plugin uses Tmux (Linux, OS X, or other Unix) or Python (Microsoft Windows) or Apple Script (Mac OS X) to send commands to R. The communication with R also depends on the R package vimcom.
