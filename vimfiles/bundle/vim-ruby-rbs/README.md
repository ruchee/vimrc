## Introduction

This plugin adds syntax highlighting and indentation for [Ruby Signature](https://github.com/ruby/rbs) (`*.rbs`) files.

## Installation

This is a standard Vim plugin which can be installed using your plugin manager of choice. If you do not already have a plugin manager, I recommend [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Alternatively, if you are using Vim 8 or NeoVim, you can install this plugin as a package; see `:h packages` for instructions.
