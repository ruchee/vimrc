PHP				*ft-php-indent* *php-indent* *php-indenting*

NOTE:	PHP files will be indented correctly only if PHP |syntax| is active.

If you are editing a file in Unix 'fileformat' and '\r' characters are present
before new lines, indentation won't proceed correctly ; you have to remove
those useless characters first with a command like: >

    :%s /\r$//g

Or, you can simply |:let| the variable PHP_removeCRwhenUnix to 1 and the
script will silently remove them when Vim loads a PHP file (at each |BufRead|).

OPTIONS: ~

PHP indenting can be altered in several ways by modifying the values of some
global variables:

								*php-comment*
To not enable auto-formating of comments by default (if you want to use your
own 'formatoptions'): >
    :let g:PHP_autoformatcomment = 0

Else, 't' will be removed from the 'formatoptions' string and "qrowcb" will be
added, see |fo-table| for more information.
-------------

To add extra indentation to single-line comments: >
    :let g:PHP_outdentSLComments = N

With N being the number of 'shiftwidth' to add.

Only single-line comments will be affected such as: >
    # Comment
    // Comment
    /* Comment */
-------------

To add extra indentation to every PHP lines with N being the number of
'shiftwidth' to add: >
    :let g:PHP_default_indenting = N

For example, with N = 1, this will give:
>
    <?php
	if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
	    if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
		if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {
		    $History_lst_sel=0;
		} else
		    $foo="bar";

	$command_hist = TRUE;
    ?>
(Notice the extra indentation between the PHP container markers and the code)
-------------

To indent PHP tags as the surrounding code: >
    :let g:PHP_outdentphpescape = 0
-------------

To automatically remove '\r' characters when the 'fileformat' is set to Unix: >
    :let g:PHP_removeCRwhenUnix = 1
-------------

To indent braces at the same level than the code they contain: >
    :let g:PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel = 1
    
This will give the following result: >
    if ($foo)
	{
	foo();
	}
Instead of: >
    if ($foo)
    {
	foo();
    }

NOTE:	Indenting will be a bit slower if this option is used because some
	optimizations won't be available.
-------------

To indent 'case:' and 'default:' statements in switch() blocks: >
    :let g:PHP_vintage_case_default_indent = 1

In PHP braces are not required inside 'case/default' blocks therefore 'case:'
and 'default:' are indented at the same level than the 'switch()' to avoid
meaningless indentation. You can use the above option to return to the
traditional way.
