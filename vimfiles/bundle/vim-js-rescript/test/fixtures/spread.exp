test/fixtures/spread.res:3:12 -> [E] (Syntax) Arrays can't use the `...` spread currently. Please use `concat` or other Array helpers.
test/fixtures/spread.res:4:6 -> [E] (Syntax) Array's `...` spread is not supported in pattern matches. Explanation: such spread would create a subarray; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data. Solution: if it's to validate the first few elements, use a `when` clause + Array size check + `get` checks on the current pattern. If it's to obtain a subarray, use `Array.sub` or `Belt.Array.slice`.
test/fixtures/spread.res:6:21 -> [E] (Syntax) Records can only have one `...` spread, at the beginning. Explanation: since records have a known, fixed shape, a spread like `{a, ...b}` wouldn't make sense, as `b` would override every field of `a` anyway.
test/fixtures/spread.res:7:15 -> [E] (Syntax) Record's `...` spread is not supported in pattern matches. Explanation: you can't collect a subset of a record's field into its own record, since a record needs an explicit declaration and that subset wouldn't have one. Solution: you need to pull out each field you want explicitly.
test/fixtures/spread.res:10:13 -> [E] (Syntax) List pattern matches only supports one `...` spread, at the end. Explanation: a list spread at the tail is efficient, but a spread in the middle would create new list[s]; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data.
