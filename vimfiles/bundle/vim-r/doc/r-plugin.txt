==============================================================================
							   *r-plugin-overview*
1. Overview~

This plugin improves Vim's support for editing R code and makes it possible to
integrate Vim with R. If you want to use Neovim and R, see:

   https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R

The plugin uses some ideas and code from Johannes Ranke's (vim-r-plugin), Eric
Van Dewoestine's (screen.vim plugin), Vincent Nijs (R.vim for Mac OS X) and
some ideas from the Tinn-R (Windows only) project.

The latest stable version of this plugin is available at:

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628

Feedback is welcomed. Please submit bug reports to the developers. Do not like
a feature? Tell us and we may add an option to disable it. If you have any
comments or questions, please post them at:

    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vim-r-plugin

The plugin should emit useful warnings if you do things it was not programmed
to deal with. Cryptic error message are bugs... Please report them at:

    https://github.com/jcfaria/Vim-R-plugin/issues

We do not plan to take the initiative of writing code for new features, but
patches and git pull requests are welcome. If you want a feature that only few
people might be interested in, you can write a script to be sourced by the
Vim-R-plugin (see |vimrplugin_source|).

						       *r-plugin-installation*
3. Installation~

The installation instructions are split in six sections:

   3.1. Preliminary system setup on Windows
   3.2. Preliminary system setup on Mac OS X
   3.3. Preliminary system setup on Unix
   3.4. Plugin installation
   3.5. Troubleshooting
   3.6. Optional steps


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Preliminary system setup on Windows~

Before installing the plugin, you should install several external
dependencies:

    * R's version must be >= 3.0.0: http://www.r-project.org/

    * vimcom = 1.2-7: http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vimcom.html

      Note: If you cannot build vimcom yourself, you will want to
      download and install the zip file.

    * Vim's version must be >= 7.4: http://www.vim.org/download.php

    * Only if you write Rnoweb code:

       * Sumatra PDF viewer >= 3.0.

       * MikTeX or other LaTeX distribution.

       * Perl (required to run `latexmk`).

Add the following lines to your `Rprofile`:
>
   options(vimcom.verbose = 1)
   library(vimcom)
<
If you do not know where your .Rprofile is, do the following command in R
Console to open it:
>
   edit(file = "~/.Rprofile")
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Preliminary system setup on Mac OS X~

Before installing the plugin, you should install its dependencies:

   Depends:~

   Cocoa MacVim >= 7.4: https://code.google.com/p/macvim

   R >= 3.0.0: http://www.r-project.org/

   vimcom = 1.2-7: http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vimcom.html

   Only if you edit Rnoweb files: MacTeX, BasicTeX or other LaTeX system.

If you want to call R.app from MacVim, put in your `~/.Rprofile`:
>
   if(interactive()){
       options(vimcom.verbose = 1) # optional
       library(vimcom)
   }
<
On Mac OS X, the plugin will use AppleScript to send commands to the R Console
application unless |vimrplugin_applescript| = 0. In this case, R will run in a
external terminal emulator. The advantage of running R in a terminal emulator
is that its output can be colorized by the R package "colorout". If you want
to try this configuration, install Tmux and the R packages "setwidth" and
"colorout" (see instructions in section 3.3) and put in your `~/.Rprofile`:
>
   if(interactive()){
       library(colorout)
       library(setwidth)
       options(vimcom.verbose = 1) # optional
       library(vimcom)
   }
<
Note: The plugin is fully functional with MacVim, but the Vim application that
comes with MacVim does not have the the server side of the 'clientserver'
feature which is required to have the plugin working properly. If you want to
run both Vim and R in the same Tmux window in a terminal emulator, you have to
follow the instructions from section 3.3.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. Preliminary system setup on Unix~

Before installing the plugin, you should install its dependencies:

   Depends:~

   Vim, GVim >= 7.4: http://www.vim.org/download.php

      Note: The Vim-R-plugin requires Vim compiled with |+libcall|,
	    |+clientserver| and |+conceal| features. In Normal mode, do
	    `:version`  to check if your Vim has these features.

	    If you need to use the Vim-R-plugin in a Unix system without the
	    X Server running (e.g. Linux Console, and any system accessed
	    through ssh), the best option is to use Neovim and Nvim-R:
	    https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R
	    If you cannot use Neovim and need to use Vim in these
	    circumstances, please, read |r-plugin-nox| and |r-plugin-remote|.

   R >= 3.0.0: http://www.r-project.org/

   vimcom = 1.2-7: http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vimcom.html

   Tmux >= 1.8:   http://tmux.sourceforge.net
                  Tmux is necessary to send commands from Vim to R Console.

   wmctrl:     http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/
               Required for better SyncTeX support under X Server.


   Suggests:~

   colorout:      http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/colorout.html
                  Colorizes the R output.

   setwidth:      An R package that can be installed with the command
                  `install.packages("setwidth")`.
                  The library setwidth adjusts the value of `options("width")`
                  whenever the terminal is resized.

   ncurses-term:  http://invisible-island.net/ncurses
		  Might be necessary if you want support for 256 colors at the
		  terminal emulator.

   latexmk:       Automate the compilation of LaTeX documents.
                  See examples in |vimrplugin_latexcmd|.

   Note: Vim, R, Tmux, ncurses-term and latexmk are already packaged for most
   GNU/Linux distributions and other Unix variants. Unfortunately their
   installation instructions vary widely and are beyond the scope of this
   documentation.

Put the following lines in your `~/.Rprofile`:
>
   if(interactive()){
       library(colorout)
       library(setwidth)
       options(vimcom.verbose = 1) # optional
       library(vimcom)
   }
<
Put the following in your `~/.bashrc`:
>
   alias vim="vim --servername VIM"
<
Before proceeding, you have to start a new shell session to have the alias
enabled.

If you start Vim in a terminal emulator, inside of a Tmux session, the plugin
will split the Tmux window in two and start R in the other pane. This is the
recommended way of running the plugin on Linux (read |r-plugin-tmux| for
details). If you either use GVim or Vim not inside a Tmux session the plugin
will start R in a external terminal emulator. This is useful if you have two
monitors.

If you run Vim in a terminal emulator, it must be started with the argument
|--servername| to enable the 'clientserver' feature (please, read the section
|r-plugin-bash-setup| to know some tips on how to configure Bash). This is not
necessary with GVim because it always runs with the 'clientserver' feature
enabled.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4. Plugin installation (instructions for all systems)~

You need to activate plugins and indentation according to 'filetype'. You
should have at least the following options at the top or near the very top
of your |vimrc| (but below `set` `runtimepath`, if you have set it):
>
   set nocompatible
   syntax enable
   filetype plugin on
   filetype indent on
<
Download the latest version of the plugin from:

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628

If you either are on Windows or prefer to use a graphical interface, start the
file manager, find the file `Vim-R-plugin.vmb` and open it with GVim or
MacVim. Otherwise, start a terminal emulator, go to the directory where you
have downloaded the plugin and type:
>
   vim Vim-R-plugin.vmb
<
Then, in Vim, type:
>
   :so %
<
Press <Enter> to start the installation and press the <Space> bar as many
times as necessary to finish the installation. You should, then, quit Vim.

Note: If you need to install the plugin in a non default directory, do
`:UseVimball` `[path]`. In this case, the configuration of Vim's 'runtimepath'
must be done before the command "filetype on" in both the system and the user
|vimrc| files, otherwise, some file types might not be correctly recognized.

The plugin is installed and will be activated next time that you start to edit
an R script.

You may want to improve the configuration of your |vimrc| for a better use of
the plugin. Please, see |r-plugin-vimrc-setup|.

If you want to uninstall the plugin, do
>
   :RmVimball Vim-R-plugin
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5. Troubleshooting (if the plugin doesn't work)~

Note: The <LocalLeader> is '\' by default.

The plugin is a |file-type| plugin. It will be active only if you are editing
a .R, .Rnw, .Rd, Rmd, or Rrst file. The menu items will not be visible and the
key bindings will not be active while editing either unnamed files or files
with name extensions other than the mentioned above. If the plugin is active,
pressing <LocalLeader>rf should start R.

Did you see warning messages but they disappeared before you have had time to
read them? Type the command |:messages| in Normal mode to see them again.

On Windows, if R does not start and you get an error message instead, you may
want to set the path to your Rgui.exe in your |vimrc|, for example (please
adapt to your installation):
>
   let vimrplugin_r_path = 'C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.1.2\\bin\\i386'
<
Are you using Debian, Ubuntu or other Debian based Linux distribution? If yes,
you may prefer to install the Debian package available at:

   http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vim-r-plugin.html

Did you see the message "VimCom port not found"? This means that R is not
running, the vimcom package is not installed (or is installed but is not
loaded), or R was not started by Vim.

If R takes more than 5 seconds to load, you should adjust the value of
|vimrplugin_vimcom_wait|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6. Optional steps~

3.6.1 Customize the plugin~

Please, read the section |r-plugin-options|. Emacs/ESS users should read the
section |r-plugin-indenting| of this document.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6.2 Install additional plugins~

You may be interested in installing additional general plugins to get
functionality not provided by this file type plugin. Particularly interesting
are vim-signature, csv.vim and snipMate. Please read |r-plugin-tips| for
details. If you edit Rnoweb files, you may want to try LaTeX-Box for
omnicompletion of LaTeX code (see |r-plugin-latex-box| for details).


==============================================================================
								*r-plugin-use*
4. Use~

4.1. Key bindings~

Note: The <LocalLeader> is '\' by default.

Note: It is recommended the use of different keys for <Leader> and
<LocalLeader> to avoid clashes between filetype plugins and general plugins
key binds. See |filetype-plugins|, |maplocalleader| and |r-plugin-localleader|.

To use the plugin, open a .R, .Rnw, .Rd, .Rmd or .Rrst file with Vim and type
<LocalLeader>rf. Then, you will be able to use the plugin key bindings to send
commands to R.

This plugin has many key bindings, which correspond with menu entries. In the
list below, the backslash represents the <LocalLeader>. Not all menu items and
key bindings are enabled in all filetypes supported by the plugin (r, rnoweb,
rhelp, rrst, rmd).

Help (plugin)
Help (R)                                            :Rhelp
-----------------------------------------------------------

Please see |r-plugin-key-bindings| to learn how to customize the key bindings
without editing the plugin directly.

The plugin commands that send code to R Console are the most commonly used. If
the code to be sent to R has a single line it is sent directly to R Console,
but if it has more than one line (a selection of lines, a block of lines
between two marks, a paragraph etc) the lines are written to a file and the
plugin sends to R the command to source the file. To send to R Console the
line currently under the cursor you should type <LocalLeader>d. If you want to
see what lines are being sourced when sending a selection of lines, you can
use either <LocalLeader>se or <LocalLeader>sa instead of <LocalLeader>ss.

The command <LocalLeader>o runs in the background the R command `print(line)`,
where `line` is the line under cursor, and adds the output as commented lines
to the source code.

If the cursor is over the header of an R chunk with the `child` option (from
Rnoweb, RMarkdown or RreStructuredText document), and you use one of the
commands that send a single line of code to R, then the plugin will send to R
the command to knit the child document.

After the send, sweave and knit commands, Vim will save the current buffer if
it has any pending changes before performing the tasks. After <LocalLeader>ao,
Vim will run "R CMD BATCH --no-restore --no-save" on the current file and show
the resulting .Rout file in a new tab. Please see |vimrplugin_routnotab| if
you prefer that the file is open in a new split window. Note: The command
<LocalLeader>ao, silently writes the current buffer to its file if it was
modified and deletes the .Rout file if it exists.

R syntax uses " <- " to assign values to variables which is inconvenient to
type. In insert mode, typing a single underscore, "_", will write " <- ",
unless you are typing inside a string. The replacement will always happen if
syntax highlighting is off (see |:syn-on| and |:syn-off|). If necessary, it is
possible to insert an actual underscore into your file by typing a second
underscore. This behavior is similar to the EMACS ESS mode some users may be
familiar with and is enabled by default. You have to change the value of
|vimrplugin_assign| to disable underscore replacement.

When you press <LocalLeader>rh, the plugin shows the help for the function
under the cursor. The plugin also checks the class of the object passed as
argument to the function to try to figure out whether the function is a
generic one and whether it is more appropriate to show a specific method. The
same procedure is followed with <LocalLeader>rp, that is, while printing an
object. For example, if you run the code below and, then, press
<LocalLeader>rh and <LocalLeader>rp over the two occurrences of `summary`, the
plugin will show different help documents and print different function methods
in each case:
>
   y <- rnorm(100)
   x <- rnorm(100)
   m <- lm(y ~ x)
   summary(x)
   summary(m)
<
If the object under the cursor is a data.frame or a matrix, <LocalLeader>rv
will show it in a new tab. If the csv.vim plugin is not installed, the
Vim-R-plugin will warn you about that (see |r-plugin-df-view|). Specially
useful commands from the csv.vim plugin are |:CSVHeader|, |:ArrangeColumn| and
|:CSVHiColumn|. It can be installed from:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2830

When completing object names (CTRL-X CTRL-O) and function arguments (CTRL-X
CTRL-A) you have to press CTRL-N to go foward in the list and CTRL-P to go
backward (see |popupmenu-completion|). Note: if using Vim in a terminal
emulator, Tmux will capture the CTRL-A command. You have to do CTRL-A twice to
pass a single CTRL-A to Vim. For rnoweb, rmd and rrst file types, CTRL-X
CTRL-A can also be used to complete knitr chunk options if the cursor is
inside the chunk header.

If R is not running or if it is running but is busy the completion will be
based on information from the packages listed by |vimrplugin_start_libs|
(provided that the libraries were loaded at least once during a session of
Vim-R-plugin usage). Otherwise, the pop up menu for completion of function
arguments will include an additional line with the name of the library where
the function is (if the function name can be found in more than one library)
and the function method (if what is being shown are the arguments of a method
and not of the function itself). For library() and require(), when completing
the first argument, the popup list shows the names of installed packages, but
only if R is running.

To get help on an R topic, type in Vim (Normal mode):
>
   :Rhelp topic
<
The command may be abbreviated to  :Rh  and you can either press <Tab> to
trigger the autocompletion of R objects names or hit CTRL-D to list the
possible completions (see |cmdline-completion| for details on the various ways
of getting command-line completion). The list of objects used for
completion is the same available for omnicompletion (see
|vimrplugin_start_libs|). You may close the R documentation buffer by
simply pressing `q`.

You can source all .R files in a directory with the Normal mode command
:RSourceDir, which accepts an optional argument (the directory to be sourced).
								    *:Rinsert*
The command  :Rinsert <cmd>  inserts one or more lines with the output of the
R command sent to R. By using this command we can avoid the need of copying
and pasting the output R from its console to Vim. For example, to insert the
output of `dput(levels(var))`, where `var` is a factor vector, we could do in
Vim:
>
   :Rinsert dput(levels(var))
<
The output inserted by  :Rinsert  is limited to 5012 characters.

The command  :Rformat  calls the function `tidy_source()` of formatR package
to format either the entire buffer or the selected lines. The value of the
`width.cutoff` argument is set to the buffer's 'textwidth' if it is not
outside the range 20-180. Se R help on `tidy_source` for details on how to
control the function behavior.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. Edition of Rnoweb files~

In Rnoweb files (.Rnw), when the cursor is over the `@` character, which
finishes an R chunk, the sending of all commands to R is suspended and the
shortcut to send the current line makes the cursor to jump to the next chunk.
While editing Rnoweb files, the following commands are available in Normal
mode:

   [count]<LocalLeader>gn : go to the next chunk of R code
   [count]<LocalLeader>gN : go to the previous chunk of R code

The commands <LocalLeader>cc, ce, cd and ca send the current chunk of R code
to R Console. The command <LocalLeader>ch sends the R code from the first
chunk up to the current line.

The commands <LocalLeader>kn builds the .tex file from the Rnoweb one using
the knitr package and <LocalLeader>kp compiles the pdf; for Sweave, the
commands are, respectively <LocalLeader>sw and <LocalLeader>sp. On Linux, if
using Evince, Okular or Zathura, you can jump from the Rnoweb file to the PDF
with the command <LocalLeader>gp. To jump from a specific location in the PDF
to the corresponding line in the Rnoweb, in either Evince or Zathura you
should press <C-LeftMouse>, and in Okular <S-LeftMouse>. No configuration is
required if you use Evince, Gnome-Terminal and the knitr package, and work
with single file Rnoweb documents. Otherwise, see |r-plugin-SyncTeX| for
configuration details.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3. Omni completion and the highlighting of functions~

The plugin adds some features to the default syntax highlight of R code. One
such feature is the highlight of R functions. However, functions are
highlighted only if their libraries are loaded by R (but see
|vimrplugin_start_libs|).

Note: If you have too many loaded packages Vim may be unable to load the list
of functions for syntax highlight.

Vim can automatically complete the names of R objects when CTRL-X CTRL-O is
pressed in insert mode (see |omni-completion| for details). Omni completion
shows in a pop up menu the name of the object, its class and its environment
(most frequently, its package name). If the object is a function, the plugin
can also show the function arguments in a separate preview window (this
feature is disabled by default: see |vimrplugin_show_args|).

If a data.frame is found, while building the list of objects, the columns in
the data.frame are added to the list. When you try to use omni completion to
complete the name of a data.frame, the columns are not shown. But when the
data.frame name is already complete, and you have inserted the '$' symbol,
omni completion will show the column names.

Only the names of objects in .GlobalEnv and in loaded libraries are completed,
and the |clientserver| feature is required to get the list of loaded libraries
automatically updated. If either R is not running or Vim is running without
the |clientserver| feature, only objects of libraries listed in
|vimrplugin_start_libs| will have their names completed. When you load a new
library in R, only the current buffer has the highlighting of function names
immediately updated. If you have other buffers open, they will be updated when
you enter them.

Vim uses one file to store the names of .GlobalEnv objects and a list of files
for all other objects. The .GlobalEnv list is stored in the `$VIMRPLUGIN_TMPDIR`
directory and is deleted when you quits Vim. The other files are stored in the
`$VIMRPLUGIN_COMPLDIR` directory and remain available until you manually delete
them.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4. The Object Browser~

You have to use <LocalLeader>ro to start the Object Browser. The Object
Browser has two views: .GlobalEnv and Libraries. If you either press <Enter>
or double click (GVim or Vim with 'mouse' set to "a") on the first line of the
Object Browser, you will toggle the view between the objects in .GlobalEnv and
the currently loaded libraries. The Object Browser requires the
|+clientserver| feature to be automatically updated and the |+conceal| feature
to correctly align list items.

In the .GlobalEnv view, if an object has the attribute "label", it will also
be displayed. In the Object Browser window, while in Normal mode, you can
either press <Enter> or double click (GVim only) over a data.frame or list to
show/hide its elements (not if viewing the content of loaded libraries). If
you are running R in an environment where the string UTF-8 is part of either
LC_MESSAGES or LC_ALL variables, unicode line drawing characters will be used
to draw lines in the Object Browser. This is the case of most Linux
distributions.

In the Libraries view, you can either double click or press <Enter> on a
library name to see its objects. In the Object Browser, the libraries have the
color defined by the PreProc highlighting group. The other objects have
their colors defined by the return value of some R functions. Each line in the
table below shows a highlighting group and the corresponding type of R object:

	 PreProc	libraries
	 Number		numeric
	 String		character
	 Special	factor
	 Boolean	logical
	 Type		list
	 Function	function
	 Statement	s4
	 Comment	promise (lazy load object)

One limitation of the Object Browser is that objects made available by the
command `data()` are only links to the actual objects (promises of lazily
loading the object when needed) and their real classes are not recognized in
the GlobalEnv view. The same problem happens when the `knitr` option
`cache.lazy=TRUE`. If you press <Enter> over the name of the object in the
Object Browser, it will be actually loaded by the command (ran in the
background):
>
   obj <- obj
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5. Commenting and uncommenting lines~

You can toggle the state of a line as either commented or uncommented by
typing <LocalLeader>xx. The string used to comment the line will be "# ",
"## " or "### ", depending on the values of |vimrplugin_indent_commented| and
|r_indent_ess_comments|.

You can also add the string "# " to the beginning of a line by typing
<LocalLeader>xc and remove it with <LocalLeader>xu. In this case, you can set
the value of vimrplugin_rcomment_string to control what string will be added
to the beginning of the line. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_rcomment_string = "# "
<
Finally, you can also add comments to the right of a line with the
<LocalLeader>; shortcut. By default, the comment starts at the 40th column,
which can be changed by setting the value of r_indent_comment_column, as
below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 20
<
If the line is longer than 38 characters, the comment will start two columns
after the last character in the line. If you are running <LocalLeader>; over a
selection of lines, the comments will be aligned according to the longest
line.

Note: While typing comments the leader comment string is automatically added
to new lines when you reach 'textwidth' but not when you press <Enter>.
Please, read the Vim help about 'formatoptions' and |fo-table|. For example,
you can add the following line to your |vimrc| if you want the comment string
being added after <Enter>:
>
   autocmd FileType r setlocal formatoptions-=t formatoptions+=croql
<
Tip: You can use Vim substitution command `:%s/#.*//` to delete all comments
in a buffer (see |:s| and |pattern-overview|).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								 *:RBuildTags*
4.6. Build a tags file to jump to function definitions~

Vim can jump to functions defined in other files if you press CTRL-] over the
name of a function, but it needs a tags file to be able to find the function
definition (see |tags-and-searches|). The command  :RBuildTags  calls the R
function `rtags()` to build the tags file for the R scripts in the current
directory. Please read |r-plugin-tagsfile| to learn how to create a tags file
referencing source code located in other directories, including the entire R
source code.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *r-plugin-tmux*
4.7. Tmux usage~

When running either GVim or Vim in a terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only), the
Vim-R-plugin will use Tmux to start R in a separate terminal emulator. R will
be running inside a Tmux session, but you will hardly notice any difference
from R running directly in the terminal emulator. The remaining of this
section refers to the case of starting R when Vim already is in a Tmux
session, that is, if you do:
>
   tmux
   vim --servername VIM filename.R
   exit
<
In this case, the terminal window is split in two regions: one for Vim and the
other for Tmux. Then, it's useful (but not required) to know some Tmux
commands. After you finished editing the file, you have to type `exit` to quit
the Tmux session.

Note: Starting GVim within a Tmux session is not supported.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							 *r-plugin-tmux-setup*
4.7.1 Tmux configuration~

If, as recommended, you always prefer to run Tmux before running you have to
create your `~/.tmux.conf` if it does not exist yet. You may put the lines
below in your `~/.tmux.conf` as a starting point to your own configuration
file:
>
   # Use <C-a> instead of the default <C-b> as Tmux prefix
   set-option -g prefix C-a
   unbind-key C-b
   bind-key C-a send-prefix

   # Options enable mouse support in Tmux
   set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
   # For Tmux < 2.1
   set -g mode-mouse on
   set -g mouse-select-pane on
   set -g mouse-resize-pane on
   # For Tmux >= 2.1
   set -g mouse on

   # Act more like vim:
   set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
   bind h select-pane -L
   bind j select-pane -D
   bind k select-pane -U
   bind l select-pane -R
   unbind p
   bind p paste-buffer
   bind -t vi-copy v begin-selection
   bind -t vi-copy y copy-selection
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.7.2 Key bindings and mouse support~

The Tmux configuration file suggested above configures Tmux to use vi key
bindings. It also configures Tmux to react to mouse clicks. You should be able
to switch the active pane by clicking on an inactive pane, to resize the panes
by clicking on the border line and dragging it, and to scroll the R Console
with the mouse wheel. When you use the mouse wheel, Tmux enters in its
copy/scroll back mode (see below).

The configuration script also sets <C-a> as the Tmux escape character (the
default is <C-b>), that is, you have to type <C-a> before typing a Tmux
command. Below are the most useful key bindings for Tmux with the tmux.conf
shown above:

    <C-a>arrow keys : Move the cursor to the Tmux panel above, below, at the
                      right or at the left of the current one.

    <C-a><C-Up>     : Move the panel division upward one line, that is, resize
                      the panels. Repeat <C-Up> to move more. <C-Down> will
                      move the division downward one line. If you are using
                      the vertical split, you should use <C-Left> and
                      <C-Right> to resize the panels.

    <C-a>[          : Enter the copy/scroll back mode. You can use <PgUp>,
                      <PgDown> and vi key bindings to move the cursor around
                      the panel. Press q to quit copy mode.

    <C-a>]          : Paste the content of Tmux paste buffer.

    <C-a>z          : Hide/show all panes except the current one.
		      Note: If you mistakenly press <C-a><C-z>, you have to
		      type `fg` to get Tmux back to the foreground.

While in the copy and scroll back mode, the following key bindings are very
useful:

    q               : Quit the copy and scroll mode.
    <Space>         : Start text selection.
    v<Space>        : Start rectangular text selection.
    <Enter>         : Copy the selection to Tmux paste buffer.

Please, read the manual page of Tmux if you want to change the Tmux
configuration and learn more commands. To read the Tmux manual, type in the
terminal emulator:
>
  man tmux
<
Note: Because <C-a> was configured as the Tmux escape character, it will not
be passed to applications running under Tmux. To send <C-a> to either R or Vim
you have to type <C-a><C-a>.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.7.3 Copying and pasting~

You do not need to copy code from Vim to R because you can use the plugin's
shortcuts to send the code. For pasting the output of R commands into Vim's
buffer, you can use the command |:Rinsert|. If you want to copy text from an
application running inside the Tmux to another application also running in
Tmux, as explained in the previous subsection, you can enter in Tmux
copy/scroll mode, select the text, copy it, switch to the other application
pane and, then, paste.

However, if you want to copy something from either Vim or R to another
application not running inside Tmux, Tmux may prevent the X server from
capturing the text selected by the mouse. This can be prevented by
pressing the <Shift> key, as it suspends the capturing of mouse events
by tmux. If you keep <Shift> pressed while selecting text with the mouse,
it will be available in the X server clipboard and can be inserted
into other windows using the middle mouse button. It can of course also be
inserted into a tmux window using <Shift> and the middle mouse button.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *r-plugin-remote*
4.7.2 Remote access~

The Vim-R-plugin can not send commands from a local Vim to a remote R, but you
can access the remote machine through ssh and run Tmux, Vim and R in the
remote machine. Tmux should not be running in the local machine because some
environment variables could pass from the local to the remote Tmux and confuse
the plugin.

If you need to access Vim in a remote Unix machine through ssh, and if you
want to get omnicompletion, syntax highlight of function names and the Object
Browser working properly, instead of Vim, it is recommended that you use
Neovim because it does not require the X Server to be fully functional. If
you cannot use Neovim, then you have to:

   - Enable X11 Forwarding in the remote machine.

   - Have Vim in the remote machine compiled with |clientserver| feature.

   - Have the X Server running in the local machine.

   - Pass either the `-X` or the `-Y` argument to ssh, as in the examples
     below:
>
     ssh -X yourlogin@remote.address
     ssh -Y yourlogin@remote.address
<
   - Start Tmux and, then, Vim with the |--servername| argument:
>
     tmux
     vim --servername VIM script.R
<
With Tmux, you can detach the Vim-R session and reattach it later (but the
connection with the XServer could be lost in the process). This is useful if
you plan to begin the use the Vim-R-plugin in a machine and later move to
another computer and access your previous Vim-R session remotely. Below is the
step-by-step procedure to run the Vim-R remotely:

  - Start Tmux:
      tmux

  - Start Vim:
      vim script.R

  - Use Vim to start an R session:
      <LocalLeader>rf

  - Send code from Vim to R, and, then, detach Vim and R with <C-a>d
    The command will be <C-b>d if you have not set <C-a> as the escape
    character in your ~/.tmux.conf.

  - Some time later (even if accessing the machine remotely) reattach the
    Tmux session:
      tmux attach


==============================================================================
							 *r-plugin-known-bugs*
5. Known bugs and workarounds~

Known bugs that will not be fixed are listed in this section. Some of them can
not be fixed because they depend on missing features in either R or Vim;
others would be very time consuming to fix without breaking anything.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1. R's source() issues~

The R's `source()` function of the base package prints an extra new line
between commands if the option echo = TRUE, and error and warning messages are
printed only after the entire code is sourced. This makes it more difficult to
find errors in the code sent to R. Details:

   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2012-December/065352.html


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2. The menu may not reflect some of your custom key bindings~

If you have created a custom key binding for the Vim-R-plugin, the menu in
GVim will not always reflect the correct key binding if it is not the same for
Normal, Visual and Insert modes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3. Functions are not always correctly sent to R~

The plugin is only capable of recognizing functions defined using the `<-`
operator. See: https://github.com/jcfaria/Vim-R-plugin/issues/94


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4. Wrong message that "R is busy" (Windows only)~

On Windows, when code is sent from Vim to R Console, the vimcom library sets
the value of the internal variable `r_is_busy` to 1. The value is set back to
0 when any code is successfully evaluated. If you send invalid code to R,
there will be no successful evaluation of code and the value of `r_is_busy`
will remain set to 1. If you then try to update the Object Browser, see the R
documentation for any function, or do other tasks that require the hidden
evaluation of code by R, the vimcom library will refuse to do the tasks to
avoid any risk of corrupting R's memory. It will tell Vim that "R is busy" and
Vim will display this message. Everything should work as expected again after
any valid code is executed in the R Console.

The vimcom library is started with the state `busy`.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*r-plugin-SyncTeX-win*
5.5. SyncTeX on Windows~

On Windows, backward search with Sumatra pop ups a console window which
quickly disappears (it is `vim` running the required `--remote-expr` command).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*r-plugin-nox*
5.6. Bugs that affect Linux Console and Vim accessed through ssh~

If you run Vim in the Linux Console or start Vim in a terminal emulator
without the command line argument |--servername|, Vim will not receive remote
messages and the vimcom package will display one of the following messages:

   Vim was built without the 'clientserver' feature.
   Did you pass the --servername argument to Vim?
   There is no X Server running.
   Vim's servername is unknown.

To avoid the message, you should start vim with the |--servername| argument,
as below:
>
   vim --servername VIM script.R
<
To avoid having to type this argument every time that you start Vim, please,
look at the example in |r-plugin-bash-setup|.

If the |--servername| argument does not work in your case, you can put the
following line in your `~/.Rprofile` to suppress the message:
>
   options(vimcom.verbose = -1)
<
When Vim cannot receive messages, the result is:

   * The Object Browser is not automatically updated. You have to do
     <LocalLeader>ro to update it manually.

   * Syntax highlight of function names and the list of objects for
     omnicompletion are not immediately updated after you load a new R
     package. For a workaround, see |vimrplugin_start_libs|.

   * You cannot see R documentation in a Vim buffer.

On Linux you may find Vim binaries without the |clientserver| feature if
you install packages such as vim-nox on Debian/Ubuntu or vim-enhanced on
Fedora/Red Hat. If you want to use Vim in a terminal emulator in Fedora/Red
Hat, you may want to create a symbolic link to "gvim" named "vim". You still
have to explicitly start the server with the argument |--servername|.

The R package vimcom has support only for Windows and X11 interprocess
communication systems while MacVim is a Cocoa application. For this reason, on
Mac OS X, by default, vimcom is built without support to Vim's |clientserver|
feature. If you prefer to use Vim instead of MacVim in Mac OS X, then, you
should:

   1. Install XQuartz server (X11.app)

   2. Build vimcom with the argument `--enable-clientserver`. That is, download
      vimcom from http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/vimcom.html and do in R:
>
      install.packages("vimcom_1.2-1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source",
                       configure.args = "--enable-clientserver")
<
   3. Build Vim with X11 support. A user reported success with the following
      procedure:
>
      brew install vim --with-client-server
      tmux
      /usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.4.273/bin/vim --servername VIM r_script.R
<
See also: |r-plugin-remote|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.7. R must be started by Vim~

The communication between Vim and R will work only if R was started by Vim
through the <LocalLeader>rf command because the plugin was designed to connect
each Vim instance with its own R instance.

If you start R before Vim, it will not inherit from Vim the environment
variables VIMRPLUGIN_TMPDIR, VIMRPLUGIN_COMPLDIR, VIMEDITOR_SVRNM,
VIMINSTANCEID, and VIMRPLUGIN_SECRET. The first one is the path used by the R
package vimcom to save temporary files used by the Vim-R-plugin to: perform
omnicompletion, show R documentation in a Vim buffer, and update the Object
Browser. The two last ones are used by the Vim-R-plugin and by vimcom to know
that the connections are valid. If you use Vim to start R, but then close
Vim, some variables will become outdated. Additionally, the Vim-R-plugin sets
the value of its internal variable SendCmdToR from SendCmdToR_fake to the
appropriate value when R is successfully started. It is possible to set the
values of all those variables manually, but, as you can see below, it is not
practical to do so. If you have either started R before Vim or closed Vim and
opened it again and really want full communication between Vim and R, you can
try the following (not all procedures are necessary for all cases):

   In Normal mode Vim do:
>
   :echo g:rplugin_tmpdir
   :echo g:rplugin_compldir
   :echo $VIMINSTANCEID
   :echo $VIMRPLUGIN_SECRET
   :echo $VIMEDITOR_SVRNM
<
   In R do:
>
   detach("package:vimcom", unload = TRUE)
   Sys.setenv(VIMRPLUGIN_TMPDIR="T")    # where "T" is what Vim has echoed
   Sys.setenv(VIMINSTANCEID="I")        # where "I" is what Vim has echoed
   Sys.setenv(VIMRPLUGIN_SECRET"="S")   # where "S" is what Vim has echoed
   Sys.setenv(VIMEDITOR_SVRNM"="N")     # where "N" is what Vim has echoed
   Sys.setenv(VIMRPLUGIN_COMPLDIR"="C") # where "C" is what Vim has echoed
   library(vimcom)
<
If you are running R in a terminal emulator (Linux/Unix) Vim still needs to
know the name of Tmux session and Tmux pane where R is running.

So, in R do:
>
   Sys.getenv("TMUX_PANE")
<
   and the following Tmux command:
>
   <Ctrl-A>:display-message -p '#S'<Enter><Enter>
<
And in Normal mode Vim do:
>
   :let rplugin_rconsole_pane = "X"
   :let rplugin_tmuxsname = "Y"
<
Finally, do one of the commands below in Normal mode Vim, according to how R
is running:
>
   let SendCmdToR = function('SendCmdToR_TmuxSplit')
   let SendCmdToR = function('SendCmdToR_Term')
   let SendCmdToR = function('SendCmdToR_OSX')
   let SendCmdToR = function('SendCmdToR_Windows')

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *vimrplugin_term*
6.1. Terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only, but not Mac OS X)~

Note: The options of this section are ignored on Mac OS X, where the command
`open` is called to run the default application used to run shell scripts.

The plugin uses the first terminal emulator that it finds in the following
list:
    1. gnome-terminal,
    2. konsole,
    3. xfce4-terminal,
    4. iterm,
    5. Eterm,
    6. (u)rxvt,
    7. aterm,
    8. roxterm,
    9. terminator,
   10. xterm.

If Vim does not select your favorite terminal emulator, you may define it in
your |vimrc| by setting the variable vimrplugin_term, as shown below:
>
   let vimrplugin_term = "xterm"
<
							 *vimrplugin_term_cmd*
If your terminal emulator is not listed above, or if you are not satisfied
with the way your terminal emulator is called by the plugin, you may define in
your |vimrc| the variable vimrplugin_term_cmd, as in the examples below:
>
   let vimrplugin_term_cmd = "gnome-terminal --title R -e"
   let vimrplugin_term_cmd = "terminator --title R -x"
<
Please, look at the manual of your terminal emulator to know how to call it.
The last argument must be the one which precedes the command to be executed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						  *vimrplugin_sleeptime*
						  *vimrplugin_save_win_pos*
						  *vimrplugin_set_home_env*
						  *vimrplugin_arrange_windows*
6.2. Options specific to Windows~


The plugin gives to R a small amount of time to process the paste command. The
default value is 100 milliseconds, but you should experiment different values. The
example show how to adjust the value of sleeptime in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_sleeptime = 30
<
By default, the Vim-R-plugin will save the positions of R Console and GVim
windows when you quit R with the <LocalLeader>rq command, and it will restore
the positions of the windows when you start R. If you do not like this
behavior, you can put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_save_win_pos = 0
   let vimrplugin_arrange_windows = 0
<
If you want R and GVim windows always in a specific arrangement, regardless of
their state when you have quited R for the last time, you should arrange them
in the way you want, quit R, change in your |vimrc| only the value of
vimrplugin_save_win_pos and, finally, quit Vim.

The plugin sets `$HOME` as the Windows register value for "Personal" "Shell
Folders" which is the same value set by R. However, if you have set `$HOME`
yourself with the intention of changing the default value of `$HOME` assumed
by R, you will want to put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_set_home_env = 0
<
Note: the old option vimrplugin_Rterm was deprecated because the C code to
send strings from Vim to Windows PowerShell is not working.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						      *vimrplugin_rnowebchunk*
	                                              *vimrplugin_assign_map*
                                                      *vimrplugin_assign*
6.3. Assignment operator and Rnoweb completion of code block~

In Rnoweb files, a `<` is replaced with `<<>>=\n@`. To disable this feature,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_rnowebchunk = 0
<
While editing R code, `_` is replaced with `<-`. If you want to bind other
keys to be replaced by `<-`, set the value of |vimrplugin_assign_map| in your
|vimrc|, as in the example below which emulates RStudio behavior (may only
work on GVim):
>
   let vimrplugin_assign_map = "<M-->"
<
Note: If you are using Vim in a terminal emulator, you have to put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   set <M-->=^[-
   let vimrplugin_assign_map = "<M-->"
<
where `^[` is obtained by pressing CTRL-V CTRL-[ in Insert mode.

Note: You can't map <C-=>, as StatET does because in Vim only alphabetic
letters can be mapped in combination with the CTRL key.

To completely disable this feature, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_assign = 0
<
If you need to type many object names with underscores, you may want to change
the value vimrplugin_assign to 2. Then, you will have to type two `_` to get
them converted into `<-`. Alternatively, if the value of vimrplugin_assign is
3, the plugin will run the following command in each buffer containing R code
(R, Rnoweb, Rhelp, Rrst, and Rmd):
>
   iabb <buffer> _ <-
<
That is, the underscore will be replaced with the assign operator only if it
is preceded by a space and followed by a non-word character.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						   *vimrplugin_objbr_place*
						   *vimrplugin_objbr_w*
						   *vimrplugin_tmux_ob*
						   *vimrplugin_objbr_opendf*
						   *vimrplugin_objbr_openlist*
						   *vimrplugin_objbr_allnames*
						   *vimrplugin_objbr_labelerr*
6.4. Object Browser options~

By default, the Object Browser will be created with 40 columns. The minimum
width of the Object Browser window is 9 columns. You can change the object
browser's default width by setting the value of |vimrplugin_objbr_w| in your
|vimrc|, as below:
>
   let vimrplugin_objbr_w = 30
<
The Object Browser is created by splitting the Vim script window, but if Vim
is running in a terminal emulator inside a Tmux session, the Object Browser
will be created in an independent Vim instance in a Tmux pane. If you prefer
the Object Browser always created as a Vim split window, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_tmux_ob = 0
<
Valid values for the Object Browser placement are "script" or "console" and
"right" or "left" separated by a comma. Examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_objbr_place = "script,right"
   let vimrplugin_objbr_place = "console,left"
<
The "console" option is valid only if Vim is running inside of a Tmux session.

Below is an example of setup of some other options in the |vimrc| that control
the behavior of the Object Browser:
>
   let vimrplugin_objbr_opendf = 1    " Show data.frames elements
   let vimrplugin_objbr_openlist = 0  " Show lists elements
   let vimrplugin_objbr_allnames = 0  " Show .GlobalEnv hidden objects
   let vimrplugin_objbr_labelerr = 1  " Warn if label is not a valid text
<
Objects whose names start with a "." are hidden by default. If you want that
they are displayed in the Object Browser, set the value of
`vimrplugin_objbr_allnames` to `1`.

when a `data.frame` appears in the Object Browser for the first time, its
elements are immediately displayed, but the elements of a `list` are displayed
only if it is explicitly opened. The options `vimrplugin_objbr_opendf` and
`vimrplugin_objbr_openlist` control the initial status (either opened or
closed) of, respectively, `data.frames` and `lists`. The options are ignored
for `data.frames` and `lists` of libraries which are always started closed.

If an object R's workspace has the attribute `"label"`, it is displayed in
Nvim's Object Browser. If the `"label"` attribute is not of class
`"character"`, and if  `vimrplugin_objbr_labelerr` is `1`, an error message is
printed in the Object Browser.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							 *vimrplugin_vimpager*
							 *vimrplugin_editor_w*
							 *vimrplugin_help_w*
6.5. Vim as pager for R help~

6.5.1. Quick setup~

If you do not want to see R documentation in a Vim's buffer, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_vimpager = "no"
<
If you want to see R documentation in Vim, but are not satisfied with the way
it works, please, read the subsection 6.5.2 below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.5.2. Details and other options:~

The plugin key bindings will remain active in the documentation buffer
allowing you to send commands to R as you would do do while editing an R
script. You can, for example, use <LocalLeader>rh to jump to another R help
document.

The valid values of vimrplugin_vimpager are:

   "tab"       : Show the help document in a new tab. If there is already a
                 tab with an R help document tab, use it.
                 This is the default.
   "vertical"  : Split the window vertically if the editor width is large
                 enough; otherwise, split the window horizontally and attempt
                 to set the window height to at least 20 lines.
   "horizontal": Split the window horizontally.
   "tabnew"    : Show the help document in a new tab.
   "no"        : Do not show R documentation in Vim.

The window will be considered large enough if it has more columns than
vimrplugin_editor_w + vimrplugin_help_w. These variables control the minimum
width of the editor window and the help window, and their default values are,
respectively, 66 and 46. Thus, if you want to have more control over Vim's
behavior while opening R's documentations, you will want to set different
values to some variables in your |vimrc|, as in the example:
>
   let vimrplugin_editor_w = 80
   let vimrplugin_editor_h = 60
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *vimrplugin_i386*
6.6. Use 32 bit version of R (Windows and Mac OS X only)~

If you are using a 64 bit Windows or a 64 bit Mac OS X, but prefer to run the
32 bit version of R, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_i386 = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *vimrplugin_r_path*
6.7. R path~

Vim will run the first R executable in the path. You can set an alternative R
path in your |vimrc| as in the examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_r_path = "/path/to/my/preferred/R/version/bin"
   let vimrplugin_r_path = "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-3.1.2\\bin\\i386"
<
On Windows, Vim will try to find the R install path in the Windows Registry.

You can set a different R version for specific R scripts in your |vimrc|.
Example:
>
   autocmd BufReadPre ~/old* let vimrplugin_r_path='~/app/R-2.8.1/bin'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *vimrplugin_r_args*
6.8. Arguments to R~

Set this option in your |vimrc| if you want to pass command line arguments to
R at the startup. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_r_args = "--sdi --no-save --quiet"
<
On Linux, there is no default value for |vimrplugin_r_args|. On Windows, the
default value is "--sdi", but you may change it to "--mdi" if you do not like
the SDI style of the graphical user interface.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						   *vimrplugin_start_libs*
6.9. Omnicompletion and syntax highlight of R functions~

The list of functions to be highlighted and the list of objects for
omnicompletion are built dynamically as the libraries are loaded by R.
However, you can set the value of vimrplugin_start_libs if you want that
the functions and objects of specific packages are respectively highlighted
and available for omnicompletion even if R is not running yet. By default,
only the functions of vanilla R are always highlighted. Below is the default
value of vimrplugin_start_libs:
>
   let vimrplugin_start_libs = "base,stats,graphics,grDevices,utils,methods"
<
You may also want to define the value of vimrplugin_start_libs if you are
running Vim without the |clientserver| feature.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*vimrplugin_routnotab*
6.10. Options for .Rout file file type~

After the command <LocalLeader>ao, Vim will save the current buffer if it has
any pending changes, run `R CMD BATCH --no-restore --no-save` on the current
file and show the resulting .Rout file in a new tab. If you prefer that the
file is open in a new split window, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_routnotab = 1
<
By default, the R commands in .Rout files are highlighted with the color of
comments, and only the output of commands has some of its elements highlighted
(numbers, strings, index of vectors, warnings and errors).

If you prefer that R commands in the R output are highlighted as they are in R
scripts, put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let Rout_more_colors = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						 *vimrplugin_indent_commented*
                                                 *r_indent_ess_comments*
						 *vimrplugin_rcomment_string*
6.11. Indent commented lines~

You can type <LocalLeader>xx to comment out a line or selected lines. If the
line already starts with a comment string, it will be removed. After adding
the comment string, the line will be reindented by default. To turn off the
automatic indentation, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_indent_commented = 0
<
What string will be added to the beginning of the line depends on the values
of vimrplugin_indent_commented and r_indent_ess_comments according to the
table below (see |r-plugin-indenting|):
>
   vimrplugin_indent_commented   r_indent_ess_comments   string
                 1                        0                #
                 0                        0                #
                 1                        1                ##
                 0                        1                ###
<
The string used to comment text with <LocalLeader>xc, <LocalLeader>xu,
<LocalLeader>xx and <LocalLeader>o is defined by vimrplugin_rcomment_string.
Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_rcomment_string = "# "
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						       *vimrplugin_notmuxconf*
6.12. Tmux configuration (Linux/Unix only)~


GVim (or Vim running R in an external terminal emulator) runs Tmux with a
specially built configuration file. If you want to use your own ~/.tmux.conf,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_notmuxconf = 1
<
If you opted for using your own configuration file, the plugin will write a
minimum configuration which will set the value of four environment variables
required for the communication with R and then source your own configuration
file (~/.tmux.conf).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						  *vimrplugin_rconsole_height*
                                                  *vimrplugin_vsplit*
			                          *vimrplugin_rconsole_width*
                                                  *vimrplugin_tmux_title*
6.13. Integration with Tmux (Linux/Unix only)~

These three options are valid only when Vim is started inside a Tmux session.
In this case, when you type <LocalLeader>rf, the terminal will be split in two
regions and R will run in one of them. By default, the Vim-R-plugin will tell
Tmux to split the terminal window horizontally and you can set in your
|vimrc| the initial number of lines of the Tmux pane running R as in the
example below:
>
   let vimrplugin_rconsole_height = 15
<
If you prefer to split it vertically:
>
   let vimrplugin_vsplit = 1
<
In this case, you can choose the initial number of columns of R Console:
>
   let vimrplugin_rconsole_width = 15
<
Tmux automatically renames window titles to the command currently running. The
Vim-R-plugin sets the title of the window where Vim and R are running to
"VimR". This title will be visible only if Tmux status bar is "on", and it is
useful only if you have created new windows with the <C-a>c command. You
can change the value of vimrplugin_tmux_title to either set a different title
or let Tmux set the title automatically. Examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_tmux_title = "Vim-R"
   let vimrplugin_tmux_title = "automatic"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *vimrplugin_applescript*
6.14. Integration with AppleScript (OS X only)~

In Mac OS X, the plugin will try to send commands to R gui using AppleScript.
If you prefer to run R in an external terminal emulator, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_applescript = 0
<
If Vim is running inside Tmux, the terminal will be split in two regions.
Otherwise, R will start in an external terminal emulator.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						      *vimrplugin_listmethods*
                                                      *vimrplugin_specialplot*
6.15. Special R functions~

The R function `args()` lists the arguments of a function, but not the arguments
of its methods. If you want that the plugin calls the function
`vim.list.args()` after <LocalLeader>ra, you have to add to your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_listmethods = 1
<
By default, R makes a scatterplot of numeric vectors. The function `vim.plot()`
do both a histogram and a boxplot. The function can be called by the plugin
after <LocalLeader>rg if you put the following line in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_specialplot = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						      *vimrplugin_source_args*
6.16. Arguments to R source() function~

When you send multiple lines of code to R (a selection of lines, a paragraph,
code between two marks or a R chunk of code), the Vim-R-plugin saves the lines
in a temporary file and, then, sends to R the command `source()` to read the
temporary file.

You can add arguments to be passed to R's `source()` function. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_source_args = "max.deparse.length = 300"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						       *vimrplugin_sweaveargs*
						       *vimrplugin_latexcmd*
						       *vimrplugin_latexmk*
						       *vimrplugin_texerr*
6.17. LaTeX options~

To produce a pdf document from the .tex file generated by either `Sweave()` or
`knit()` command, if vimrplugin_latexmk = 1 and both `latexmk` and `perl`
(which is required to run `latexmk`) are installed and in the path, the vimcom
package calls:
>
   latexmk -pdflatex="pdflatex -file-line-error -synctex=1" -pdf
<
Otherwise, it calls:
>
   pdflatex -file-line-error -synctex=1
<
You can use the options vimrplugin_latexcmd and vimrplugin_latexmk to change
this behavior. Examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_latexmk = 0
   let vimrplugin_latexcmd = "latex"
   let vimrplugin_latexcmd = 'latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="xelatex %O -synctex=1 %S"'
<
By default, vimrplugin_latexmk is 0 on Windows and 1 on other systems.
If you want to pass arguments to the `Sweave()` function, set the value of the
vimrplugin_sweaveargs variable.

If the value of `vimrplugin_texerr` is `1`, a summary of LaTeX errors
and warnings are produced by the compilation of the .tex document into .pdf
file will be output to R Console at the end of the compilation. So, you do not
have to scroll the R Console seeking for these messages.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						  *vimrplugin_rmd_environment*
6.18. Rmd environment~

When rendering an Rmd file, the code can be evaluated (and saved) in a
specified environment.  The default value is `.GlobalEnv` which makes the
objects stored in the Rmd file available on the R console.  If you do not want
the  objects stored in the Rmd file to be available in the global environment,
you can set
>
    let vimrplugin_rmd_environment = "new.env()"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						*vimrplugin_never_unmake_menu*
6.19. Never unmake the R menu~

Use this option if you want that the "R" menu item in GVim is not deleted when
you change from one buffer to another, for example, when going from an .R file
to a .txt one:
>
   let vimrplugin_never_unmake_menu = 1
<
When this option is enabled all menu items are created regardless of the file
type. If you have added R related tool bar buttons (see |r-plugin-toolbar|)
the buttons also are created at the plugin startup and kept while you go to
different file type buffers.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *vimrplugin_map_r*
6.20. Map 'r'~

If the variable |vimrplugin_map_r| exists, the plugin will map the letter 'r'
to send lines to R when there are visually selected lines, for compatibility
with the original plugin. To activate this option, insert the following into
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_map_r = 1
<
You may want to add the following three lines to your |vimrc| which were in
Johannes Ranke's plugin and will increase compatibility with code edited with
Emacs:
>
   set expandtab
   set shiftwidth=4
   set tabstop=8
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *vimrplugin_ca_ck*
6.21. Add ^A^K to the beginning of commands~

When one types <C-a> in the R Console the cursor goes to the beginning of the
line and when one types <C-k> the characters to the right of the cursor are
deleted. This is useful to avoid characters left on the R Console being mixed
with commands sent by Vim. However, sending <C-a> may be problematic if using
Tmux. The Vim-R-plugin will add <C-a><C-k> to every command if you put
in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_ca_ck = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	                                                *vimrplugin_pdfviewer*
                                                        *vimrplugin_openpdf*
                                                        *vimrplugin_openhtml*
6.22. Open PDF after processing rnoweb, rmd or rrst files~

The plugin can automatically open the pdf file generated by pdflatex, after
either `Sweave()` or `knit()`. This behavior is controlled by the variable
|vimrplugin_openpdf| whose value may be 0 (do not open the pdf), 1 (open only
the first time that pdflatex is called) or a number higher than 1 (always
open the pdf). For example, if you want that the pdf application is started
automatically but do not want the terminal (or GVim) losing focus every time
that you generate the pdf, you should put in put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_openpdf = 1
<
If you use Linux or other Unix and eventually use the system console (without
the X server) you may want to put in your |vimrc|:
>
   if $DISPLAY != ""
       let vimrplugin_openpdf = 1
   endif
<
Note: If the pdf is already open, some pdf readers will automatically update
the pdf; others will lock the pdf file and prevent R from successfully
compiling it again. You can change the value of vimrplugin_pdfviewer in your
|vimrc| to define what PDF viewer will be called. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_pdfviewer = "zathura"
<
If editing an Rmd file, you can produce the html result with <LocalLeader>kh.
The html file will be automatically opened if you put the following in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_openhtml = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *vimrplugin_rrstcompiler*
			                             *vimrplugin_strict_rst*
                                                     *vimrplugin_rst2pdfpath*
			                             *vimrplugin_rst2pdfargs*
6.23. Support to RreStructuredText file~

By default, the Vim-R-plugin sends the command `render_rst(strict=TRUE)` to R
before using R's `knit()` function to convert an Rrst file into an rst one. If
you prefer the non strict rst code, put the following in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_strict_rst = 0
<
You can also set the value of vimrplugin_rst2pdfpath (the path to rst2pdf
application), vimrplugin_rrstcompiler (the compiler argument to be passed to R
function knit2pdf), and vimrplugin_rst2pdfargs (further arguments to be passed
to R function knit2pdf).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						 *vimrplugin_insert_mode_cmds*
6.24. Allow R commands in insert mode~

Vim-R commands are designed to work in insert mode as well as normal mode.
However, depending on your <LocalLeader>, this can make it very difficult to
write R packages or Sweave files.  For example, if <LocalLeader> is set to the
`\` character, typing `\dQuote` in a .Rd file tries to send the command!

The option vimrplugin_insert_mode_cmds disables commands in insert mode.  To
use it, add the following to your |vimrc|:
>
   let g:vimrplugin_insert_mode_cmds = 0
<
The default value is 1, for consistency with earlier versions.

See also: |r-plugin-localleader|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							 *vimrplugin_allnames*
							 *vimrplugin_rmhidden*
6.25. Show/remove hidden objects~

Hidden objects are not included in the list of objects for omni completion. If
you prefer to include them, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let g:vimrplugin_allnames = 1
<
Hidden objects are removed from R workspace when you do <LocalLeader>rm. If
you prefer to remove only visible objects, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let g:vimrplugin_rmhidden = 0
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *vimrplugin_source*
6.26. Source additional scripts~

This variable should contain a comma separated list of Vim scripts to be
sourced by the Vim-R-plugin. These scripts may provide additional
functionality and/or change the behavior of the Vim-R-plugin. If you have such
scripts, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_source = "~/path/to/MyScript.vim,/path/to/AnotherScript.vim"
<
Currently, there are only two scripts known to extend the Vim-R-plugin
features:

   Support to the devtools R package~
   https://github.com/mllg/vim-devtools-plugin

   Basic integration with GNU screen~
   https://github.com/ssayols/screenR


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *vimrplugin_restart*
6.27. Restart R if it is already running (Linux/Unix only)~

When R is already running and you type one of the commands to start R before
you have done <LocalLeader>rq, the Vim-R-plugin does one of the following:
(a) If R is in an external terminal emulator, the terminal is closed, a new
one is opened with the same R session running in it. (b) If both Vim and R are
running in different Tmux regions of the same terminal emulator, the plugin
warns that R is already running.

If instead of the default behavior, you prefer to quit and restart R when you
do <LocalLeader>rf, <LocalLeader>rv or <LocalLeader>rc, then, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_restart = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*vimrplugin_show_args*
						   *vimrplugin_args_in_stline*
6.28. Function arguments~

If you want that Vim shows a preview window with the function arguments as you
do omnicompletion, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_show_args = 1
<
The preview window is not shown by default because it is more convenient to
run <Ctrl-X><Ctrl-A> to complete the function arguments. The preview window
will be shown only if "preview" is also included in your 'completeopt'.

If you want that function arguments are displayed in Vim's status line when
you insert `(`, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_args_in_stline = 1
<
The status line is restored when `)` is typed. This option is useful only if
the window has a status line. See |laststatus|. If the string with the list of
arguments is longer than the status line width, the list is not displayed
completely. This argument is incompatible with any plugin that changes the
status line because it is always restored to the value that it had at Vim's
startup. Functions of .GlobalEnv do not have their arguments displayed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						      *vimrplugin_vimcom_wait*
6.29. Time to wait for vimcom loading~

The Vim-R-plugin waits 5000 milliseconds for vimcom package to be loaded
during R startup. It then checks whether you are using the correct version of
vimcom. If 5000 milliseconds is not enough to your R startup, then set a
higher value for the variable in your |vimrc|. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_vimcom_wait = 10000
<
Note: You should have the line  `library(vimcom)`  in your `~/.Rprofile`.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *vimrplugin_vim_wd*
6.30 Start R in working directory of Vim~

When you are editing an R file (.R, .Rnw, .Rd, .Rmd, .Rrst) and start R, the
R package vimcom runs the command `setwd()` with the directory of the file
being edited as argument, that is, the R working directory becomes the same
directory of the R file. If you want R's working directory to be the same as
Vim's working directory, put in your |vimrc|:
>
    let vimrplugin_vim_wd = 1
<
This option is useful only for those who did not enable 'autochdir'.

If you prefer that the Vim-R-plugin does not set the working directory in any
way, put in |vimrc|:
>
    let vimrplugin_vim_wd = -1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						      *vimrplugin_after_start*
6.31 System command to execute after R startup~

If you want that Vim executes a command right after R startup, set the value
of vimrplugin_after_start in your |vimrc|.

For example, if you are using GVim and running R in the Gnome-terminal,
`~/bin` is in your path, and you want to resize and change the positions of
GVim and the Terminal windows, you may create a script `~/bin/after_R_start`
with the following contents
>
   #!/bin/sh
   wmctrl -F -r R -e 0,0,200,1200,800
   wmctrl -r GVIM -e 0,300,40,1200,800
<
make the script executable, and put in your |vimrc|:
>
   if has("gui_running")
       let vimrplugin_after_start = "after_R_start"
   endif
<
On Mac OS X, if you are using MacVim and R.app, the `~/bin/after_R_start`
contents might be:
>
   #!/bin/sh
   osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to set the bounds of the front window to {0, 200, 1200, 1000}'
   osascript -e 'tell application "MacVim" to set the bounds of the front window to {300, 40, 1500, 840}'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						   *vimrplugin_user_maps_only*
6.32 Only set key bindings that are user specified~

The Vim-R-plugin sets many default key bindings.  The user can set custom
key bindings (|r-plugin-key-bindings|).  If you wish the Vim-R-plugin to only
set those key-bindings specified by the user, put in your vimrc:
>
    let vimrplugin_user_maps_only = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *vimrplugin_tmpdir*
							 *vimrplugin_compldir*
6.33 Temporary files directories~

You can change the directories where temporary files are created and
stored by setting in your |vimrc| the values of vimrplugin_tmpdir and
vimrplugin_compldir, as in the example below:
>
   let vimrplugin_tmpdir = "/dev/shm/R_tmp_dir"
   let vimrplugin_compldir = "~/.cache/Vim-R-plugin"
<
The default paths of these directories depend on the operating system. If you
want to know they are, while editing an R file, do in Normal mode:
>
   :echo g:rplugin_tmpdir
   :echo g:rplugin_compldir
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *r-plugin-df-view*
6.34 View a data.frame or matrix~

The csv.vim plugin helps to visualize and edit csv files, and if it is not
installed, the Vim-R-plugin will warn you about that when you do
<LocalLeader>rv. If you do not want to install the csv.vim plugin, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_csv_warn = 0
<
If you rather prefer to see the table in a graphical viewer, you should set
the value of vimrplugin_csv_app in your |vimrc|. Examples:
>
   let vimrplugin_csv_app = "localc"
   let vimrplugin_csv_app = "c:/Program Files (x86)/LibreOffice 4/program/scalc.exe"
<
There is also the option of configuring the Vim-R-plugin to run an R command
to display the data. Example:
>
   let vimrplugin_df_viewer = "relimp::showData(%s, font = 'Courier 14')"
<
The value of vimrplugin_df_viewer is a string and the substring `%s` is
replaced by the name of the object under the cursor.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *r-plugin-SyncTeX*
6.35 SyncTeX support~

SyncTeX is a set of communication systems used by some PDF viewers and by some
text editors which allow users to jump from a specific line in the text editor
to the corresponding line in the PDF viewer and vice-versa. The Vim-R-plugin
has support for Evince, Zathura and Okular SyncTeX systems.

To completely disable SyncTeX support, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_synctex = 0
<
The application `wmctrl` is required to raise both the PDF viewer and Vim
windows.

No configuration is required if you use Evince and the knitr package, and
single file Rnoweb documents. Otherwise, keep reading...

If you use `Sweave()` rather than `knit()`, you must put in your Rnoweb
document:
>
   \SweaveOpts{concordance=TRUE}
<
If you work with a master document and child subdocuments, each child
subdocument (TeX and Rnoweb alike) should include the following line:
>
   % !Rnw root = master.Rnw
<
where `master.Rnw` must be replaced with the name of the actual master
document.

Note: The current knitr package (version 1.7) has at least two limitations:

   - It has no SyncTeX support for child documents. The correspondence data
     point to lines just below child chunks in the master document and not to
     somewhere in the child documents themselves. See:
     https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/225

   - It only starts registering the concordance after the first chunk. So, it
     is recommended that you put the first chunk of R code just after the
     `\begin{document}` command.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.35.1 Evince configuration~

No configuration should be required.

Note: If Evince is not started yet when you try to jump to the PDF document
for the first time, it will start, but will not jump to desired line; you have
to press <LocalLeader>gp again.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.35.2 Okular configuration~

You have to configure Okular to call Vim during backward searches.
In Okular, click in:
>
   Settings
   Configure Okular
   Editor
   Dropdown menu: Custom Text Editor
         Command: vim --remote-expr "SyncTeX_backward('%f', %l)"

In the command above, replace `vim` with `gvim` if you use GVim.

If Evince is not installed in your system, the Vim-R-plugin will automatically
use Okular as the PDF viewer. Otherwise, you have to set the value of
|vimrplugin_pdfviewer| to "okular":
>
   let vimrplugin_pdfviewer = "okular"
<
Note: If the PDF document is already open the first time that you jump to it,
and if Okular was not started with the `--unique` argument, another instance
of Okular will be started.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.35.3 Zathura configuration~

No configuration should be required if Evince is not installed. If evince is
installed, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let vimrplugin_pdfviewer = "zathura"
<
Zathura version must be >= 0.3.1.

Note: If Zathura is not started yet when you try to jump to the PDF document
for the first time, it will start, but will not jump to desired line; you have
to press <LocalLeader>gp again.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.35.4 Skim with MacVim configuration (Mac OS X)~

You have to configure Skim to call MacVim during backward searches.
In Skim click in the drop down menu and fill the fields:
>
   Skim
   Settings
   Sync
   Preset: Custom
   Command: /path/to/MacVim/mvim
   Arguments: --remote-expr "SyncTeX_backward('%file', %line)"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.35.5 Sumatra configuration (Windows)~

No configuration is required.


==============================================================================
						       *r-plugin-key-bindings*
7. Custom key bindings~

When creating custom key bindings for the Vim-R-plugin, it is necessary to
create three maps for most functions because the way the function is called is
different in each Vim mode. Thus, key bindings must be made for Normal mode,
Insert mode, and Visual mode.

To customize a key binding you should put in your |vimrc| something like:
>
   nmap <LocalLeader>sr <Plug>RStart
   imap <LocalLeader>sr <Plug>RStart
   vmap <LocalLeader>sr <Plug>RStart
<
The above example shows how to change key binding used to start R from
<LocalLeader>rf to <LocalLeader>sr.

Only the custom key bindings for Normal mode are shown in Vim's menu, but you
can type |:map| to see the complete list of current mappings, and below is the
list of the names for custom key bindings (the prefix RE means "echo";
RD, "cursor down"; RED, both "echo" and "down"):

   Start/Close R~
   RStart
   RCustomStart
   RClose
   RSaveClose

   Clear R console~
   RClearAll
   RClearConsole

   Edit R code~
   RSimpleComment
   RSimpleUnComment
   RToggleComment
   RRightComment
   RCompleteArgs
   RIndent
   RNextRChunk
   RPreviousRChunk

   Send line or part of it to R~
   RSendLine
   RDSendLine
   RSendLAndOpenNewOne
   RNLeftPart
   RNRightPart
   RILeftPart
   RIRightPart
   RDSendLineAndInsertOutput

   Send code to R console~
   RSendSelection
   RESendSelection
   RDSendSelection
   REDSendSelection
   RSendSelAndInsertOutput
   RSendMBlock
   RESendMBlock
   RDSendMBlock
   REDSendMBlock
   RSendParagraph
   RESendParagraph
   RDSendParagraph
   REDSendParagraph
   RSendFunction
   RESendFunction
   RDSendFunction
   REDSendFunction
   RSendFile
   RESendFile

   Send command to R~
   RHelp
   RPlot
   RSPlot
   RShowArgs
   RShowEx
   RShowRout
   RObjectNames
   RObjectPr
   RObjectStr
   RViewDF
   RSetwd
   RSummary
   RListSpace

   Support to Sweave and knitr~
   RSendChunk
   RDSendChunk
   RESendChunk
   REDSendChunk
   RSendChunkFH (from the first chunk to here)
   RBibTeX    (Sweave)
   RBibTeXK   (Knitr)
   RSweave
   RKnit
   RMakeHTML
   RMakeODT
   RMakePDF   (Sweave)
   RMakePDFK  (Knitr)
   RMakePDFKb (.Rmd, beamer)
   RMakeRmd   (rmarkdown default)
   RMakeAll   (rmarkdown all in yaml)
   ROpenPDF
   RSyncFor   (SyncTeX search forward)
   RGoToTeX   (Got to LaTeX output)
   RSpinFile
   RNextRChunk
   RPreviousRChunk

   Object browser~
   RUpdateObjBrowser
   ROpenLists
   RCloseLists

The completion of function arguments only happens in Insert mode. To customize
its keybind you should put in your |vimrc| something as in the example:
>
   imap <C-A> <Plug>RCompleteArgs
<
The plugin also contains a function called RAction which allows you to build
ad-hoc commands to R. This function takes the name of an R function such as
"levels" or "table" and the word under the cursor, and passes them to R as a
command.

For example, if your cursor is sitting on top of the object called gender and
you call the RAction function, with an argument such as levels, Vim will pass
the command `levels(gender)` to R, which will show you the levels of the
object gender. To make it even easier to use this and other functions, you
could write custom key bindings in your |vimrc|, as in the examples below:
>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>rk :call RAction("levels")<CR>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>t :call RAction("tail")<CR>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>h :call RAction("head")<CR>
<
If the command that you want to send does not require an R object as argument,
you can create a shortcut to it by following the example:
>
   map <silent> <LocalLeader>s :call g:SendCmdToR("search()")
<

							       *r-plugin-tips*
9. FAQ and tips~

9.1. Is it possible to stop R from within Vim?~

Yes. In Normal mode do `:RStop` and Vim will send SIGINT to R which is the
same signal sent when you press CTRL-C into R's Console.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.2. Html help and custom pager~

If you prefer to see help pages in an html browser, put in your `~/.Rprofile`:
>
   options(help_type = "html")
<
and in your |vimrc| (see |vimrplugin_vimpager|):
>
   let vimrplugin_vimpager = "no"
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *r-plugin-showmarks*
9.3. How do marked blocks work?~

Vim allows you to put several marks (bookmarks) in buffers. The most commonly
used marks are the lowercase alphabet letters. If the cursor is between any
two marks, the plugin will send the lines between them to R if you press
<LocalLeader>bb. If the cursor is above the first mark, the plugin will send
from the beginning of the file to the mark. If the cursor is below the last
mark, the plugin will send from the mark to the end of the file. The mark
above the cursor is included and the mark below is excluded from the block to
be sent to R. To create a mark, press m<letter> in Normal mode.

We recommended the use of vim-signature which show what lines have marks
defined. The plugins are available at:

   https://github.com/kshenoy/vim-signature


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *r-plugin-snippets*
9.4. Use snipMate~

You probably will want to use the snipMate plugin to insert snippets of code
in your R script. The plugin may be downloaded from:

   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540

The snipMate plugin does not come with snippets for R, but you can copy the
files r.snippets and rmd.snippets that ship with the Vim-R-plugin (look at the
r-plugin directory) to the snippets directory. The files have only a few
snippets, but they will help you to get started. If you usually edit rnoweb
files, you may also want to create an rnoweb.snippets by concatenating both
tex.snippets and r.snippets. If you edit R documentation, you may want to
create an rhelp.snippets


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *r-plugin-bindings*
9.5. Easier key bindings for most used commands~

The most used commands from Vim-R-plugin probably are "Send line" and "Send
selection". You may find it a good idea to map them to the space bar in your
|vimrc| (suggestion made by Iago Mosqueira):
>
   vmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendSelection
   nmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendLine
<
You may also want to remap <C-x><C-o>:

   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2269005/how-can-i-change-the-keybinding-used-to-autocomplete-in-vim

Note: Not all mappings work in all versions of Vim. Some mappings may not work
on GVim on Windows, and others may not work on Vim running in a terminal
emulator or in Linux Console. The use of <Shift>, <Alt> and <Fn> keys in
mappings are particularly problematic. See:

   https://github.com/jcfaria/Vim-R-plugin/issues/111

You can also use Vim's 'clientserver' feature to send remote messages to Vim.
For example, if you want a keyboard shortcut that sends to Vim the command to
send the current line to R and go down to the next line of code, then use your
desktop configuration tools to create a global shortcut to the following
command:
>
   vim --remote-expr 'SendLineToR("down")'
<
The command above will work properly only if there is a single Vim instance
running. Otherwise, the |--servername| argument would have to be used to send
the message to the correct Vim instance. If the command works properly, you
will be able to send lines of code from Vim to R even if the window
currently focused is not the Vim's window (either the terminal emulator where
Vim is running or GVim).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*r-plugin-localleader*
9.6. Remap the <LocalLeader>~

People writing Rnoweb documents may find it better to use a comma or other key
as the <LocalLeader> instead of the default backslash (see |maplocalleader|).
For example, to change the <LocalLeader> to a comma, put at the beginning of
your |vimrc| (before any mapping command):
>
   let maplocalleader = ","
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *r-plugin-tagsfile*
9.7. Use a tags file to jump to function definitions~

Vim can jump to a function definition if it finds a "tags" file with the
information about the place where the function is defined. To generate the
tags file, use the R function `rtags()`, which will build an Emacs tags file.
If Vim was compiled with the feature |emacs_tags|, it will be able to read the
tags file. Otherwise, you can use the vimcom function `etags2ctags()` to
convert the Emacs tags file into a Vim's one. To jump to a function
definition, put the cursor over the function name and hit CTRL-]. Please, read
|tagsrch.txt| for details on how to use tags files, specially the section
|tags-option|.

You could, for example, download and unpack R's source code, start R inside
the ~/.vim directory and do the following commands:
>
   rtags(path = "/path/to/R/source/code", recursive = TRUE, ofile = "RTAGS")
   etags2ctags("RTAGS", "Rtags")
<
Then, you would quit R and do the following command in the terminal emulator:
>
   ctags --languages=C,Fortran,Java,Tcl -R -f RsrcTags /path/to/R/source/code
<
Finally, you would put the following in your |vimrc|, optionally inside an
|autocmd-group|:
>
   autocmd FileType r set tags+=~/.vim/Rtags,~/.vim/RsrcTags
   autocmd FileType rnoweb set tags+=~/.vim/Rtags,~/.vim/RsrcTags
<
Note: While defining the autocmd, the Rtags path must be put before RsrcTags.

Example on how to test whether your setup is ok:

   1. Type `mapply()` in an R script and save the buffer.
   2. Press CTRL-] over "mapply" (Vim should jump to "mapply.R").
   3. Locate the string "do_mapply", which is the name of a C function.
   4. Press CTRL-] over "do_mapply" (Vim sould jump to "mapply.c").


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *r-plugin-indenting*
9.8. Indenting setup~

Note: In Normal mode, type |==| to indent the current line and gg=G to format
the entire buffer (see |gg|, |=| and |G| for details). These are Vim commands;
they are not specific to R code.

The Vim-R-plugin includes a script to automatically indent R files. By
default, the script aligns function arguments if they span for multiple lines.
If you prefer do not have the arguments of functions aligned, put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_align_args = 0
<
By default, all lines beginning with a comment character, `#`, get the same
indentation level of the normal R code. Users of Emacs/ESS may be used to have
lines beginning with a single `#` indented in the 40th column, `##` indented as R
code, and `###` not indented. If you prefer that lines beginning with comment
characters are aligned as they are by Emacs/ESS, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_comments = 1
<
If you prefer that lines beginning with a single # are aligned at a column
different from the 40th one, you should set a new value to the variable
r_indent_comment_column, as in the example below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 30
<
By default any code after a line that ends with "<-" is indented. Emacs/ESS
does not indent the code if it is a top level function. If you prefer that the
Vim-R-plugin behaves like Emacs/ESS in this regard, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_compatible = 1
<
Below is an example of indentation with and without this option enabled:
>
   ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 1           ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 0
   foo <-                                    foo <-
       function(x)                               function(x)
   {                                             {
       paste(x)                                      paste(x)
   }                                             }
<
Notes: (1) Not all code indented by Emacs/ESS will be indented by the
           Vim-R-plugin in the same way, and, in some circumstances it may be
           necessary to make changes in the code to get it properly indented
           by Vim (you may have to either put or remove braces and line
           breaks).
       (2) Indenting is not a file type plugin option. It is a feature defined
           in indent/r.vim. That is why it is documented in this section.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *r-plugin-folding*
9.9. Folding setup~

Vim has several methods of folding text (see |fold-methods| and
|fold-commands|). To enable the syntax method of folding for R files, put in
your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_syntax_folding = 1
<
With the above option, Vim will load R files with all folds closed. If you
prefer to start editing files with all folds open, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   set nofoldenable
<
Notes: (1) Enabling folding may slow down Vim. (2) Folding is not a file type
plugin option. It is a feature defined in syntax/r.vim.

Note: Indentation of R code is very slow because the indentation algorithm
sometimes goes backwards looking for an opening parenthesis or brace or for
the beginning of a `for`, `if` or `while` statement. This is necessary because
the indentation level of a given line depends on the indentation level of the
previous line, but the previous line is not always the line above. It's the
line where the statement immediately above started. Of course someone may
develop a better algorithm in the future.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.10. Highlight chunk header as R code~

By default, Vim will highlight chunk headers of RMarkdown and
RreStructuredText with a single color. Chunk headers should contain valid R
code when the code is processed by knitr, so you may want to highlight them as
such. You can do this by putting in your |vimrc|:
>
   let rrst_syn_hl_chunk = 1
   let rmd_syn_hl_chunk = 1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.11. Automatically close parenthesis~

Some people want Vim automatically inserting a closing parenthesis, bracket or
brace when an open one has being typed. The page below explains how to achieve
this goal:

   http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_append_closing_characters


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.12. Automatic line breaks~

By default, while editing R code, Vim does not break lines when you are typing
if you reach the column defined by the 'textwidth' option. If you prefer that
Vim breaks the R code automatically put in your |vimrc|:
>
   autocmd FileType r setlocal formatoptions+=t
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.13. Vim with 256 colors in a terminal emulator (Linux/Unix only)~

If you want 256 colors support in Vim, install the package ncurses-term. Then
put in your `~/.bashrc` the lines suggested at |r-plugin-bash-setup|.

You have to search the internet for color schemes supporting 256 colors,
download and copy them to ~/.vim/colors. You may use the command
|:colorscheme| to try them one by one before setting your preference in your
|vimrc|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.14. Run your Makefile from within R~

Do you have many Rnoweb files included in a master tex or Rnoweb file and use
a Makefile to build the pdf? You may consider it useful to put the following
line in your |vimrc|:
>
   nmap <LocalLeader>sm :update<CR>:call g:SendCmdToR('system("make")')<CR>
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							   *r-plugin-Rprofile*
9.15. Edit your ~/.Rprofile~

You may want to edit your `~/.Rprofile` in addition to considering the
suggestions of |r-plugin-R-setup| you may also want to put the following
lines in your `~/.Rprofile` if you are using Linux:
>
   grDevices::X11.options(width = 4.5, height = 4, ypos = 0,
                          xpos = 1000, pointsize = 10)
<
The `X11.options()` is used to choose the position and dimensions of the X11
graphical device. You can also install the application wmctrl and create
shortcuts in your desktop environment to the commands
>
   wmctrl -r "R Graphics" -b add,above
   wmctrl -r "R Graphics" -b remove,above
<
which will toggle the "always on top" state of the X11 device window.
Alternatively, you can right click on the X11 device window title bar and
choose "Always on top". This is useful to emulate a feature present in R IDEs
which can display R plots in a separate panel. Although we can not embed an R
graphical device in Vim, we can at least make it always visible over the
terminal emulator or the GVim window.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.16. Debugging R functions~

The Vim-R-Plugin does not have debugging facilities, but you may want to use
the R package "debug":
>
   install.packages("debug")
   library(debug)
   mtrace(function_name)
<
Once the library is installed and loaded, you should use `mtrace(function_name)`
to enable the debugging of a function. Then, the next time that the function
is called it will enter in debugging mode. Once debugging a function, you can
hit <Enter> to evaluate the current line, `go(n)` to go to line `n` in the
function and `qqq()` to quit the function (See debug's help for details). A
useful tip is to click on the title bar of the debug window and choose "Always
on top" or a similar option provided by your desktop manager.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.17. Disable syntax highlight of R functions~

If you want to disable the syntax highlight of R functions put in your
|vimrc|:
>
   autocmd Syntax * syntax clear rFunction
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *r-plugin-latex-box*
9.18. Integration with LaTeX-Box~

LaTeX-Box does not automatically recognize Rnoweb files as a valid LaTeX file.
You have to tell LaTeX-BoX that the .tex file compiled by either `knitr()` or
`Sweave()` is the main LaTeX file. You can do this in two ways. Suppose that
your Rnoweb file is called report.Rnw... You can:

    (1) Create an empty file called "report.tex.latexmain".

    or

    (2) Put in the first 5 lines of report.Rnw:

        % For LaTeX-Box: root = report.tex

Of course you must run either `knitr()` or `Sweave()` before trying LaTeX-Box
omnicompletion. Please, read LaTeX-Box documentation for more information.

See also: |vimrplugin_latexcmd|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							*r-plugin-quick-setup*
9.19. Suggested setup for the Vim-R-plugin~

Please, look at section |r-plugin-options| if you want information about the
Vim-r-plugin customization.

Here are some suggestions of configuration of Vim, Bash, Tmux and R. To
understand what you are doing, and change the configuration to your taste,
please read this document from the beginning.

							*r-plugin-vimrc-setup*
   ~/.vimrc~
>
   " Minimum required configuration:
   set nocompatible
   syntax on
   filetype plugin on
   filetype indent on

   " Change Leader and LocalLeader keys:
   let maplocalleader = ","
   let mapleader = ";"

   " Use Ctrl+Space to do omnicompletion:
   if has("gui_running")
       inoremap <C-Space> <C-x><C-o>
   else
       inoremap <Nul> <C-x><C-o>
   endif

   " Press the space bar to send lines and selection to R:
   vmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendSelection
   nmap <Space> <Plug>RDSendLine

   " The lines below are suggestions for Vim in general and are not
   " specific to the improvement of the Vim-R-plugin.

   " Highlight the last searched pattern:

       library(colorout)
       library(setwidth)
       library(vimcom)

       # Use the text based web browser w3m to navigate through R docs
       # in Linux Console after help.start():
       if(Sys.getenv("TMUX") != "" && Sys.getenv("DISPLAY") == "")
	   options(browser = function(u) system(paste0("tmux new-window 'w3m ", u, "'")))
   }
<

							 *r-plugin-bash-setup*
   ~/.bashrc (Linux, Mac OS X, and other Unix systems):~
>
   # Change the TERM environment variable (to get 256 colors) even if you are
   # accessing your system through ssh and using either Tmux or GNU Screen:
   if [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ] || [ "$TERM" = "xterm-256color" ]
   then
       export TERM=xterm-256color
       export HAS_256_COLORS=yes
   fi
   if [ "$TERM" = "screen" ] && [ "$HAS_256_COLORS" = "yes" ]
   then
       export TERM=screen-256color
   fi

   # Make Vim connect to X Server even if the gui is not running (many of the
   # plugin features depend on this).
   if [ "x$DISPLAY" != "x" ]
   then
       alias vim='vim --servername VIM'
   fi
<


Finally, if you want to use vi key bindings in Bash or other shell:

   ~/.inputrc~
>
   set editing-mode vi
   set keymap vi
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.20. Syntax highlight of .Rout files~

You can set the foreground colors of R output in your |vimrc|. The example
below is for a terminal emulator that supports 256 colors (see |:highlight|):
>
   if &t_Co == 256
       let rout_color_input    = 'ctermfg=247'
       let rout_color_normal   = 'ctermfg=202'
       let rout_color_number   = 'ctermfg=214'
       let rout_color_integer  = 'ctermfg=214'
       let rout_color_float    = 'ctermfg=214'
       let rout_color_complex  = 'ctermfg=214'
       let rout_color_negnum   = 'ctermfg=209'
       let rout_color_negfloat = 'ctermfg=209'
       let rout_color_date     = 'ctermfg=184'
       let rout_color_true     = 'ctermfg=78'
       let rout_color_false    = 'ctermfg=203'
       let rout_color_inf      = 'ctermfg=39'
       let rout_color_constant = 'ctermfg=179'
       let rout_color_string   = 'ctermfg=172'
       let rout_color_error    = 'ctermfg=15 ctermbg=1'
       let rout_color_warn     = 'ctermfg=1'
       let rout_color_index    = 'ctermfg=186'
   endif
<
To know what number corresponds to your preferred color (among the 256
possibilities), hover you mouse pointer over the table of colors at the end
of http://www.lepem.ufc.br/jaa/colorout.html

If you prefer that R output is highlighted using you current |:colorscheme|,
put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let rout_follow_colorscheme = 1
<
